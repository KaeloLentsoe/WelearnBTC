We explore ₿itcoin while documenting our educational journey. We're not ₿itcoin educators—just having fun sharing knowledge -- This is an open-source project. The aim is to empower one another.#Orangepillme

This includes notes from Mastering Web3 MOOC for University of Nicosia. 

## The internet’s evolution: Web1 -> Web2 -> Web3

Web1 (1990-2005): The first version of the internet, defined by:
 • Static web pages and open protocols (e.g., HTTP, SMTP, FTP).
 • Users could read and consume content but had limited interaction.
 
 Web2 (2005-2020): The era of centralized platforms:
 • Rise of corporations controlling the internet (Google, Facebook, Amazon, etc.).
 • User-generated content became dominant, but platforms controlled monetization and visibility.
 • Data centralization led to privacy issues and platform-driven economies

 Web3 (2020+): The shift to decentralized digital economies:
 • Blockchain-based applications remove intermediaries.
 • Users have ownership over their data, digital assets, and online identities.
 • Smart contracts enable automated, trustless transactions without centralized control
